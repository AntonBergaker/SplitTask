# SplitTask
SplitTask was going to be a free open source task management software that lets you divide your tasks into smaller and easier to manage subtasks. It's able to import and save task-lists locally, and is also able to connect to a webserver where many users can be on the same task-list.

Development was interrupted because [dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) can cover all of this and more.
